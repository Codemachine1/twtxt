Welcome to twtxt!
=================

Welcome to twtxt's documentation. This documentation is divided into multiple parts.
We recommend you to get started with the :ref:`installation` and then head over to the
:ref:`quickstart` section. There is a more detailed :ref:`usage` section about how to use
twtxt from the CLI. The internals of twtxt are documented in the :ref:`api` chapter.

Feel free to contribute to this project. The source code is maintained on `Github`_.
